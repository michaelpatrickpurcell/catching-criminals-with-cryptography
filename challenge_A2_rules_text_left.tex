\textsf{\LARGE Overview}\\[1.0ex]

A transposition cipher reorders the positions of the characters in a \underline{\textbf{m}}essage but does not change the characters themselves.\\[1.25ex]

%You will need a copy of these rules and something to write with.\\[1.125ex]
In a col\underline{\textbf{u}}mnar transposition cipher, the message i\underline{\textbf{s}} written out in rows of fixed length, and then read out column-by-column.\\[1.25ex]

Both the w\underline{\textbf{i}}dth of the rows and the ordering of the columns is determined by a se\underline{\textbf{c}}ret keyword agreed upon ahead of time by the message's sender and receiver.\\[3.0ex]

\textsf{\LARGE Encryption}\\[1.0ex]

To encrypt a message with a keyword of length $n$:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
	\item Write the message in a grid with $n$ columns.\\[1.25ex]
	\item Number the columns of the resulting  grid according to the alphabetical ordering of the letters of the keyword.
	\item Read down the columns of the grid in increasing order of the numbers assigned to the columns in step 2.
\end{enumerate}
