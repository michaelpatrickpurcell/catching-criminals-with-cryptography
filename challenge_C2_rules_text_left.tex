\textsf{\LARGE Overview}\\[1.0ex]

The Playfair cipher is a \underline{\textbf{c}}ipher in w\underline{\textbf{h}}ich each pair of consecutive characters is replaced by another.\\[1.25ex]

How this is done \underline{\textbf{i}}s determined by a secret keyword that is agreed upon ahead of ti\underline{\textbf{m}}e by the message's sender and rec\underline{\textbf{e}}iver.\\[3ex] 

\textsf{\LARGE Encryption}\\[1.0ex]

To encrypt a message with a keyword of length $n$:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
	\item Write out the keyword as the first $n$ entries in a $5\times 5$ table. Fill the rest of the table with the remaining letters (omit \texttt{Q}).\\[1.25ex]
	\item Insert an \texttt{X} between any repeated letters. Break the message into digraphs.  %Replace repeated or missing letters with \texttt{X}s.
	\item Replace each digraph via:
	
	If both letters appear in the same row, replace each one with the letter to its right.
	
	If both letters appear in the same column, replace each one with the letter below it.
	
	%Otherwise, replace it with the letters at the opposite corners of the rectangle that it defines.
	
	Otherwise, replace each letter with the one on the same row as it and the same column as the other letter in the digraph.
