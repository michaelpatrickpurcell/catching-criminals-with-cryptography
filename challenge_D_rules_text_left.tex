\textsf{\LARGE Overview}\\[1.0ex]

The Four-Square cipher is a cipher in which each pair of consecutive characters is replaced by another.\\[1.25ex]

%A set of four tables are used to encode the substitution alphabet.\\[1.25ex]

How this is done is determined by four tables which are derived from a pair of secret keywords agreed upon ahead of time by the message's sender and receiver.\\[3ex] 

\textsf{\LARGE Encryption}\\[1.0ex]

To encrypt a message with the keywords $k_1$ and $k_2$:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
	\item Write out $k_1$ as the first entries in the bottom-left  table. Fill the rest of the table with the remaining letters (omit \texttt{Q}).\\[1.25ex]
	\item Write out $k_2$ as the first entries in the top-right table. Fill the rest of the table with the remaining letters (omit \texttt{Q}).\\[1.25ex]
	\item Replace each digraph $x_1x_2$ via:
	
	Locate $x_1$ in the top-left table and $x_2$ in the bottom-right table.
	
	Locate the letters $y_1$ in the top-right table and $y_2$ in the bottom-left table that complete the rectangle defined by $x_1x_2$.
	
	Replace $x_1x_2$ with $y_1y_2$.
